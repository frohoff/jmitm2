/**

 *
 *  Implements the new keys message, sent after completioin of key exchange.
 *  </p> <p>
 *
 *  Key exchange ends by each side sending an SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS message. This
 *  message is sent with the old keys and algorithms. All messages sent after
 *  this message MUST use the new keys and algorithms. </p> <p>
 *
 *  When this message is received, the new keys and algorithms MUST be taken
 *  into use for receiving. </p> <p>
 *
 *  This message is the only valid message after key exchange, in addition to
 *  SSH_MSG_DEBUG, SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT and SSH_MSG_IGNORE messages. The purpose
 *  of this message is to ensure that a party is able to respond with a
 *  disconnect message that the other party can understand if something goes
 *  wrong with the key exchange. Implementations MUST NOT accept any other
 *  messages after key exchange before receiving SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS. </p> <b>byte
