/**
 * <p>
 * This interface provides external access to messaging services supplied by
 * the SSH API.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When a party wants to receive an incoming message it simply registers its
 * interest with the transport protocol through registerMessage(). Messages
 * are then routed to the synchronized message store object supplied during
 * registration where any waiting threads are notified. This framework for
 * message routing is implemented by the abstract Service class.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Messages should be unregistered by services especially if the service is
 * temporary, such as Authenticaiton services. Messages are sent through the
 * transport layer by using sendMessage(). This requires an additional
 * identification object (typically passed as 'this') so that the transport
 * layer can filter messages whilst in key exchange. (only transport protocol
 * messages are valid during the key exchange process.
 * </p>
